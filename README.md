# Crystal Commune

# Plot

In the crystaline void a troop of animals yearn to build a home for themselves.

# Gameplay Hints

- Mines have better yield when placed close to crystals.
- Animals get hungry after working.

# Building instructions

1. Install Allegro 5.
2. Install Rust from rust-lang.org. You'll need the nightly version.
3. Run `cargo run --release` to build and run the game.

On Windows, you can use the pre-built binaries (extracted in the `allegro`
subdirectory). `run_msys.sh` may be useful for this purpose.

# Rules

*Fable: all characters are animals* The city is inhabited by animals.

## Artistic requirements

*Iridescence* All crystals play tricks with the light.

*All Dialog must be implemented comic-book bubble style* The animals
communicate their wants via thought bubbles.

## Technical requirement

*Implement a chart (bar chart, pie chart, any kind of chart)* There are two
charts in the game that display the money and population over time.

## Bonus

Not used.
